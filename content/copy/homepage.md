## The Solo Founder's Dilemma

You have a world-changing idea. But everyone says you need a world-sized team.

### Pain Points

#### ðŸ”¥ Burning Out Before Breaking Through
- Working 80-hour weeks with diminishing returns
- Drowning in operational tasks instead of strategic growth
- Watching competitors with full teams move faster

#### ðŸŽ¯ Losing Focus Across Too Many Priorities
- Juggling product, marketing, sales, and operations solo
- Context switching costs killing your productivity
- Important work lost in the urgent chaos

#### ðŸš« Traditional Wisdom Says It's Impossible
- VCs want to see a "complete team"
- Industry veterans say you can't scale alone
- The startup playbook wasn't written for solopreneurs

#### ðŸ’¡ Your Vision Deserves Better
- You know there's a smarter way to build
- Technology should multiply your efforts, not complicate them
- Focus should be your superpower, not your weakness

---

## The Unicorn of One Method

### Radical Focus Methodology
Stop doing everything. Start doing only what matters.

#### The 10x Rule
If it won't 10x your business, it doesn't deserve your time. Our proprietary focus framework identifies and eliminates 90% of "busy work" that's keeping you small.

#### One Thing Daily
Master the discipline of choosing one needle-moving activity each day. Watch your progress compound exponentially.

#### Strategic No System
Learn to say no to good opportunities to make room for great ones. We'll show you exactly how to evaluate every decision.
