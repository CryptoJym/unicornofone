# AI Playbook Launch Email Sequence

## Pre-Launch Email (T-3 Days)
**Subject**: The AI secret that replaced my entire team
**Send**: 3 days before launch

[Name],

Three years ago, I had 52 employees.
Today, I have zero.

My revenue? It's 4x higher.

How?

I discovered something that changes everything for solo founders...

**AI isn't just a tool. It's your entire team.**

But here's the problem:

99% of founders use AI like a fancy Google search. They're leaving millions on the table.

This Tuesday, I'm releasing something that changes that.

The Solo Founder's AI Playbook - the exact system I used to:
- Replace a $2M payroll with $200/month in AI tools
- Cut my workweek from 70 to 20 hours
- Scale faster than funded competitors

Want early access?

**[Join the VIP List ‚Üí]**

First 100 people get:
- 40% off launch price
- Exclusive bonuses worth $500+
- First access when doors open

This changes everything,
Alex

P.S. Sarah Chen used this system to hit $2.4M ARR solo. Her secret? She'll share it Tuesday.

## Launch Day - Email 2 (2 PM)
**Subject**: The $50K mistake I see every week
**Send**: Launch day, 2 PM

[Name],

Quick story:

Last week, a founder told me he just hired his 5th employee.

Monthly burn rate: $50K
Productivity increase: Maybe 20%

I showed him one automation from the AI Playbook.

It did the work of 3 of his employees.
Cost: $47/month.

He literally put his head in his hands.

**This is the $50K mistake I see every week.**

Founders hiring humans for AI work.

Look, I'm not anti-employee. But I am pro-intelligence.

And right now, intelligent founders are using AI to:
- Write better than most copywriters
- Analyze data faster than analysts
- Support customers better than support teams
- Create content faster than agencies

The Solo Founder's AI Playbook shows you exactly how.

**[See What's Inside ‚Üí]**

Fair warning: We're at 67/100 VIP spots claimed.

Once they're gone, it's full price ($297) with no bonuses.

The choice is yours:
- Keep hiring and burning cash
- Or build an AI team that never sleeps

Choose wisely,
Alex

P.S. Jennifer Park built and sold for $5M using these systems. Her competition had 40 employees. She had this playbook.

## Day 2 - Social Proof Blast
**Subject**: 500+ solo founders can't be wrong
**Send**: Day 2, 10 AM

[Name],

Yesterday was insane.

89 VIP spots claimed.
11 left.

But here's what matters more...

The messages flooding in from founders already implementing:

"Module 2 saved me 15 hours THIS WEEK" - Rachel T.

"The automation templates are ridiculous. Built 3 before lunch." - David K.

"Why did I wait so long? Already ROI positive." - Sam M.

Here's the truth:

While you're reading this, other solo founders are:
- Implementing AI systems that 10x their output
- Automating tasks they used to do manually
- Scaling faster than funded competitors

**You can join them right now.**

**[Claim Your Final VIP Spot ‚Üí]**

What you get:
‚úÖ Complete AI Playbook ($297 value)
‚úÖ 150+ proven prompts ($500 value)
‚úÖ 20 automation templates ($1,000 value)

Your investment: Just $178 (40% off)

But only if you act fast. These final spots won't last the day.

To your transformation,
Alex

P.S. Tomorrow I'll share the #1 AI prompt that generates $10K+/month for users. VIP members get all 150+ today.

Look, I know you're busy.

But being busy isn't the same as being productive.

This playbook is the difference between:
- Working 70 hours vs. 20 hours
- Growing linearly vs. exponentially  
- Building a job vs. building an asset

The founders who get this are winning.
The ones who don't are burning out.

Which will you be?

This is your last chance at VIP pricing.

Choose growth,
Alex

## Post-Launch Follow-Up
**Subject**: Missed the VIP pricing? Here's what to do...
**Send**: Day 4

[Name],

The VIP launch is over.

100 spots claimed in 72 hours.

If you missed it, I'm sorry. 

But I have good news...

The Solo Founder's AI Playbook is still available at regular price.

No bonuses. No discounts. But the same transformative content.

**[Get Your Copy at Regular Price ‚Üí]**

Is it still worth $297?

Ask the 500+ founders already using it:
- Average time saved: 32 hours/week
- Average revenue increase: 3.2x in 6 months
- ROI: Often within first week

Or don't take their word for it.

Keep doing what you're doing.
Keep getting what you're getting.

But remember:

Every day without AI leverage is a day your competitors pull ahead.

Your call.

P.S. Next week I'm shutting down sales to focus on supporting current members. This might be your last chance for a while.
