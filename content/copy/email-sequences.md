# Unicorn of One - Email Sequences

## Welcome Sequence (5 emails)

### Email 1: Welcome - The Path Less Traveled
**Subject**: You're in! Here's your first unicorn insight...
**Send**: Immediately

Hey [Name],

Welcome to Unicorn of One. You've just joined a movement of 1,000+ founders who refuse to accept that building a billion-dollar business requires a billion-dollar team.

I'm Alex Mitchell, and 5 years ago I was exactly where you might be now:
- Big vision, small team (me)
- Burning out trying to do everything
- Wondering if the "hire fast" crowd was right

Then I discovered something that changed everything...

**Your First Unicorn Principle: The 10x Test**

Before you do ANYTHING today, ask yourself: "Will this 10x my business?"

If the answer isn't a clear yes, delegate it to AI or delete it entirely.

Try it for just one day. Reply and let me know what you eliminated.

Tomorrow, I'll share the AI system that replaced my first 3 hires.

To your solo success,
Alex Mitchell
Founder, Unicorn of One

P.S. Seriously, reply with what you're eliminating. I read every email.

### Email 2: The AI Team
**Subject**: Meet your new team (they never sleep)
**Send**: Day 2

[Name],

Yesterday I asked you to eliminate non-10x work. How did it go?

Today, let me introduce you to the team that's been waiting for you:

**Your AI Squad:**
- Claude: Your strategic advisor (better than any consultant)
- ChatGPT: Your content team (writes faster than 10 humans)
- Perplexity: Your research department (knows everything)
- Zapier: Your operations manager (never drops the ball)

But here's what nobody tells you about AI...

It's not about the tools. It's about the SYSTEMS.

A solo founder using AI randomly = still overwhelmed
A solo founder using AI systematically = unstoppable force

**Quick Win for Today:**
Pick ONE repetitive task you do daily. Could be email responses, social media, or data entry.

Build a simple AI workflow for it. Just one.

That's how Jennifer Park started. 18 months later, she sold for $5M with zero employees.

Tomorrow: The "Strategic No" system that 3x'd my growth rate.

Exponentially yours,
Alex

P.S. Our next cohort opens in 2 weeks. Just saying... ðŸ˜‰

### Email 3: The Power of No
**Subject**: Why I said no to $2M in revenue
**Send**: Day 4

[Name],

True story: Last year, I turned down a $2M contract.

My friends thought I'd lost my mind. But here's what they didn't see...

That contract would have consumed 60% of my time for 12 months. The opportunity cost? About $10M in lost growth from my core business.

**The Strategic No Formula:**

1. Calculate the TRUE time cost (not just hours, but mental energy)
2. Multiply by your hourly value (revenue Ã· hours worked)
3. Compare to your best alternative opportunity
4. If it's not 10x better, it's a no

This isn't about being arrogant. It's about being strategic.

Every "yes" to good kills a "yes" to great.

**Your Challenge:**
List 3 things you're doing out of obligation, not opportunity. Pick one to eliminate this week.

Sarah Chen did this exercise and dropped 3 "good" clients. Six months later? $2.4M ARR.

Tomorrow: The daily ritual that changed everything.

Stay focused,
Alex

P.S. Struggling with what to cut? Reply with your list. I'll help you choose.

### Email 4: One Thing Daily
**Subject**: The 6-minute morning ritual worth $1M+
**Send**: Day 6

[Name],

Every morning at 5:54 AM, I do something unusual.

I sit with a blank piece of paper and write ONE thing.

Not a to-do list. Not goals. Just ONE thing that will move my business forward most today.

Then I do that thing first. Before email. Before Slack. Before the world wakes up.

**The compound effect is staggering:**
- 1 needle-mover per day = 365 per year
- 365 focused actions > 3,650 scattered tasks
- Result: Exponential growth while others linear struggle

Marcus Rodriguez used this to go from 0 to 50K users. Solo.

**Try it tomorrow:**
1. Wake up
2. Coffee (optional but recommended)
3. One paper, one pen
4. One thing that matters most
5. Do it before anything else

That's it. No app needed. No complexity.

Just focus.

Final email tomorrow: Your invitation to something special.

One thing at a time,
Alex

### Email 5: Your Unicorn Moment
**Subject**: Ready to build your billion-dollar vision?
**Send**: Day 8

[Name],

Over the past week, you've learned:
âœ“ The 10x Test (eliminate everything else)
âœ“ AI Systems (your tireless team)
âœ“ Strategic No (protect your yes)
âœ“ One Thing Daily (compound focus)

These aren't just concepts. They're the exact system I used to build and exit three companies, the last one in just 18 months solo.

But here's the truth...

**Information isn't transformation.**

You need three things to actually build your unicorn:
1. A proven system (you've seen a glimpse)
2. Accountability (the solo founder's kryptonite)
3. A guide who's been there (hi ðŸ‘‹)

That's why I created Unicorn of One.

**This week only, I'm opening 20 spots for Strategy Sessions.**

In 60 minutes, we'll:
- Analyze your business for 10x opportunities
- Design your AI leverage system
- Create your 90-day scaling roadmap
- See if Unicorn of One is right for you

No pitch fest. If we're not 100% confident we can help you scale, we'll tell you.

[BOOK YOUR STRATEGY SESSION â†’]

These spots typically fill in 48 hours.

To your unicorn future,
Alex

### Email 3: Deadline Approaching
**Subject**: 48 hours left (then it's a 6-week wait)
**Send**: 5 days after session

[Name],

Quick update: We're closing enrollment for the [Month] Unicorn of One cohort in 48 hours.

Next cohort won't start for 6 weeks.

I know you're busy building, but consider this:

Every week you delay systematizing your growth is a week of:
- Scattered focus instead of strategic progress
- Manual work instead of AI leverage
- Going it alone instead of community support

The founders who move fast, win fast.

If you're ready: [FINAL ENROLLMENT LINK]

If not, no worries. I'll keep sending you valuable insights either way.

To your timing,
Alex

If you changed your mind, no worries at all. But I'm curious - what held you back? Your feedback helps me improve the program.
